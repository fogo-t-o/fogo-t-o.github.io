<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
<p>
My name is Fogo and I engineer computer systems. 
Here, you can learn more about my projects and research.
<br/><br/>
I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="http://csc.ncsu.edu">Computer Science department</a> of NC State University. 
In particular, I am exploring my Machine Learning and Security interests at the Systems (<a href="http://dance.csc.ncsu.edu">DANCE</a>) lab group supervised by <a href="http://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/xgu/">Dr. Xiaohui (Helen) Gu</a>.
<br/>
I graduated from NC State University with a Masters of Science degree in Computer Science in 2019. In 2017, I graduated with Bachelor of Science degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from NC State University as well.
