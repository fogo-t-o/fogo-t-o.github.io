I am a second year PhD student at the <a href="http://csc.ncsu.edu">Computer Science department</a> of NC State University. 
In particular, I am exploring my Machine Learning and Security interests at the Distributed Systems (<a href="http://dance.csc.ncsu.edu">DANCE</a>) lab group supervised by Dr. Xiaohui (Helen) Gu.
