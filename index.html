<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
<p>
My name is Fogo and I like to engineer computer systems. Here, you can learn more about my projects and research.

I am a second year PhD student at the [Computer Science department](http://csc.ncsu.edu) of NC State University. 
In particular, I am exploring my Machine Learning and Security interests at the Distributed Systems ([DANCE](http://dance.csc.ncsu.edu)) lab group supervised by Dr. Xiaohui (Helen) Gu.

I graduated from NC State University with Bachelor of Science degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2017.
