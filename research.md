My research is centered on improving the potency of intrusion detection systems.
This includes investigating the detection of security bug exploits in application (Docker) containers using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, particularly unsupervised ML techniques.  
More recently, I have been investigating understanding the underlying vulnerabilities with program analysis techniques.

Here are my projects.
